      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>A Scholarly HTML document is a valid <a role="doc-biblioref">HTML</a> document that follows some additional rules to specialize its meaning and make it predictable to processors wishing to produce or consume scholarly articles. These rules are outlined in the following sections. While valuable on its own, the content structure defined here is simply a stepping stone to enable semantic enrichment, detailed in <a href="#semantics">Semantics Overlays</a>. If you would like to write a validation tool, please join us on GitHub. </p>
<section id="Root">
      <h3>The <code>Root</code> and <code>Head</code></h3>
      <p>The document must be encoded in UTF-8 and transmitted with a media type of <code>text/html</code>.
      <p>The <code>head</code> must contain <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code> element and a <code>title</code> element.</p>
    </section>

<section id="article">
      <h3>The <code>Article</code></h3>
      <p>The first child of <code>article</code> must be <code>header</code>. The header should contain an <code>&lt;H1&gt;</code> with the title of the document. The following element must be a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with the role of <code>"contentinfo"</code> containing author and affilitation information. See <a href="#contentinfo-semantics">The <code>contentinfo</code> Region Semantics</a> for information about the semantic decoration of this element.</p>
      <p><code>Section</code> elements may be listed within the article at arbitrary depths, but each <code>section</code> must begin with an <code>hx</code> element, indicating a numbered section in the article. If the sections require headings that exceed <code>h6</code>, <code>aria-level</code> must be included to indicate depth.</p>
<p>Each section may contain zero or more <i>Hunk Elements</i> and <code>section</code> elements.</p>
</section>
<section id="hunk">
<h3>Hunk Elements</h3>
<p>Hunk elements are the meaningful blocks from which sections are built. They contain text and inline elements. There are several types of hunk elements. All content, ranging from long paragraphs to note references and footnotes can be captured using this specified set of elements. The method for distinguishing one from another in a machine-readable manner is specified in <a href="#semantics">Semantics Overlay.</a></p>
<p>The most common hunk element is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/semantics.html#the-p-element"><code>p</code></a>.
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/semantics.html#the-blockquote-element"><code>blockquote</code></a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/semantics.html#the-ul-element"><code>ul</code></a>, <a href ="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/semantics.html#the-ol-element"<code>ol</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/semantics.html#the-dl-element"><code>dl</code></a> elements can be used as they typically would and require no special treatment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/semantics.html#the-dl-element"<code>aside</code></a> hunk element is used to capture portions of content that stand apart from the main flow of content. These can be separated from the article without having impact on the reader's understanding of the article. A common use is text boxes in print. If the <code>aside</code> contains an <code>header</code> heading element, that heading must be the first element child and its numeric part must reflect its depth, making use of aria-level according to the same rules as apply for section. The other children of aside must all be hunk elements. For example, if an <code>aside</code> follows a <code>section</code> with a level 3 heading, the top-level heading in the <code>aside</code> should be <code>h4</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/semantics.html#the-figure-element"><code>figure</code></a> element is a general container for self-contained content units that are embedded inside the main body of the text. It can come in several flavors that are dictated by its typeof attribute. Common uses for <code>figure</code> are as a container for images, tables, equations, and computer code.</p> <!-- add link to sem -->

<p>If <code>figure</code> is <code>typeof="sa:image"</code>, it is an image container. It must contain an <code>img</code> child element and should contain a <code>figcaption</code> labeling that image.</p>

If <code>figure</code> is a <code>typeof="sa:table"</code>table, it is a table container. It must contain a <code>table</code> element. If there is a table caption, it should be included using the <code>caption</code> child element of the table, and not the <code>figcaption</code> child of the <code>figure</code>. Table notes may also be included as <code>ol</code> with a <code>li</code> elements with the role of <code>doc-footnote</code>.

If <code>figure</code> is a <code>typeof="sa:formula"</code>, it is a formula container. It must contain a <code>math</code> element and, optionally, a <code>figcaption</code> describing the formula. The <code>math</code> element must be valid MathML 3. Additionally, given the dismal state of support for MathML in Web browser the math element must contain an annotation descendant with the TeX equivalent of the formula.

If <code>figure</code> is a <code>typeof="schema:SoftwareSourceCode"</code>, it is a code container. It must contain a <code>pre</code> element and, optionally, a <code>figcaption</code>. The <code>pre</code> element must contain a <code>code</code> element as its only child.
</section>

<section id="inline">
<h3>Inline Elements</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/semantics.html#text-level-semantics">Inline elements</a> decorate, describe, and enrich text. Inside of hunk elements, heading elements, and captioning elements and inline elements can be used (and where applicable they can nest within one another).</p>
</section>
<section id="references">
   <h3>References</h3>
   <p>The References section requires specific semantic overlays (reference) as well as strict content structure. Apart from a (required) <code>hx</code> element, it must contain only one <code>ol</code> or <code>dl</code> element.</p>
   <p>If using a <code>dl</code> element, the contents must be alternating <code>dt</code> and <code>dd</code> elements. The <code>dd</code> must contain the citation.</p>
   <p>If using <code>ol</code>, the only contents are <code>li</code> that include citations.</p> <!--add references to sem as well as CSS to rearrange order based on citation format -->

<h3>Interactive Elements</h3>

<section id="validate">
   <h3>Validation</h3>
   <p>The only validation requirement for Scholarly HTML at this point is that the HTML is valid. We are considering building a a validation tool in RelaxNG or JavaScript to check compliance with this set of rules.
    <p>Articles should be in the following basic structure:
      <ul>
        <li>heading with article title</li>
        <li>0+ hunks</li>
        <li>0+ sections
          <ul>
          <li>0+ headings</li>
          <li>0+ hunks</li>
          <li>0+ sections</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
         </ul>
         </p>
<p>It must feature a <code>DOCTYPE</code> as its preamble.</p>

      <h2>Semantics Overlay</h2>
      <p>
        HTML provides an excellent backbone with which to capture the
        <a href="#structure">structure</a> of a given text but is evidently limited when it comes to
        capturing more domain-specific concepts such as people, spaceships,
        <a href="http://existentialcomics.com/comic/122">Humean causation</a>, or
        <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109888">sthenurines</a>.
        That is where semantic overlays with the ability to refine the meaning and relations of
        HTML elements come into play. Scholarly HTML makes use of two standard mechanisms that
        overlay additional semantics atop the HTML DOM: role-based semantics as defined by
        <a role="doc-biblioref">WAI-ARIA</a> and <a role="doc-biblioref">DPUB-ARIA</a>, and
        semantics rooted in structured data as captured by <a role="doc-biblioref">RDFa</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using technologies related to the semantic web can at times feel daunting and unrelated to
        everyday web development. In order to suppress this disconnect, Scholarly HTML follows a
        few simple guiding principles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The number of prefixes used for semantic properties is kept as small as possible;
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no such thing as a URI (or URN, IRI, XRI, or whatever else confusing
          contraption), everything is a URL;
        </li>
        <li>
          Where somewhat more complex modeling is required, it is put together using a small set of
          common patterns that might require some initial learning but can be applied regularly
          with relative ease (notably <a href="#roles">roles</a> and actions).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The properties that Scholarly HTML uses are naturally document-related (authorship,
        keywords, license, citations, as well as specific structure types such as acknowledgements,
        introduction, or funding), which additionally requires the ability to describe people and
        organizations. There are numerous vocabularies that address this domain and which could be
        used with <a role="doc-biblioref">RDFa</a>; however, for reasons detailed in
        <a href="https://research.science.ai/article/web-first-data-citations#choice-of-ontology">Web-First
        Data Citations</a> Scholarly HTML relies almost exclusively on
        <a role="doc-biblioref">schema.org</a>, complemented by a small number of additions from
        the <a href="#scholarly-article">Scholarly Article Vocabulary</a>.

        -->
        <p>
          It is worth taking a step back to understand the importance of the <em>role</em>
          modeling. Its application is clearly exemplified in the <a href="#authors">Authors &amp;
          Contributors</a> section wherein a <a>sa:ContributorRole</a> type is used as a wrapper
          and not <a>schema:Person</a> or <a>schema:Organization</a> directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roles are an indirection that provides additional information about a property or
          relationship. A simple overview is provided in the schema.org blog post
          <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2014/06/introducing-role.html">Introducing 'Role'</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's look at the example of authorship information. Some properties of the agent who
          authored the document (person or organization), such as their name, are considered to be
          true outside the limited context of the document. These properties will be set directly on
          the agent.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, other properties are considered to be specific to the agent
          <em>in their role as author of the document</em>. To give an example, were I to be
          writing the document you are currently reading as a freelancer for the Illuminati, my
          affiliation to them would be solely in my role as author and I should not be considered
          eternally indentured to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a role is used to enrich a property, the convention is to have it as the value of
          that property, and then to repeat the property on the role to point to the object. At
          first glance it sounds contrived, but it is a simple and powerful construct. To stay with
          the authoring example, the indirection would look like:
        </p>
        <p>
          <a>schema:ScholarlyArticle</a> ⟼
          <em><a>schema:author</a></em> ⟼
          <a>sa:ContributorRole</a> ⟼
          <em><a>schema:author</a></em> ⟼
          <a>schema:Person</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          To demonstrate how properties can attach differently to the role and to the agent, we can
          unfold the authorship example further:

        <h3>Article and Title Semantics</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>article</code> element that roots the content of the Scholarly HTML document
          needs further refinement to capture the specific type of article that it encodes. The
          <code>typeof</code> attribute should always contain <a>schema:ScholarlyArticle</a> as its
          first item, but it can be further refined with additional article types.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          Should we recommend a specific taxonomy for article (sub)typing? There are so many:
          Fabio, MeSH, NPG…
        </p>
        <p>
          In order for arbitrary parts of the document to be able to attach metadata to the
          <code>article</code>, it also needs to have its <code>resource</code> attribute set to a
          URL that can be referenced (it is typically sufficient to just use <code>#</code> for that
          purpose).
        </p>
        <p>
          While the <code>h1</code> in the document's <code>header</code> is sufficient to convey
          the fact that it is the document's title, some services use extraneous information in
          order to assign an unambiguous title to the document. As such, it needs to have its
          <code>property</code> attribute set to <a>schema:name</a>. Similary, if a subtitle is
          present in the <code>header</code> it needs to be decorated with both a <code>role</code>
          of <code>doc-subtitle</code> (to expose its <a role="doc-biblioref">DPUB-ARIA</a>
          semantics) and a <code>property</code> of <a>schema:alternateName</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If appropriate, the beginning of the <code>article</code> is also a good place in which to
          capture the accessibility properties of the document, using the relevant parts of
          <a role="doc-biblioref">schema.org</a> (<a>schema:accessibilityFeature</a>,
          <a>schema:accessibilityHazard</a>, <a>schema:accessibilityAPI</a>, and

          As described in the <a href="#structure">Structure section</a>, the <code>contentinfo</code>
          region serves as a container for the metadata of the article. It is itself nothing more
          than a <code>div</code> with a <code>role</code> of <code>contentinfo</code>, but its

            If the document has authors or contributors, they are listed in a <code>section</code>
            with <code>typeof</code> <a>sa:ArticleList</a>. The content of that <code>section</code>
            is an <code>h2</code> title appropriate for it, followed by either a <code>ul</code> or
            <code>ol</code> (depending on whether the authors are considered ordered, which is
            highly dependent on the discipline's culture).
          </p>
          <p>
            Each <code>li</code> in that list must feature a <code>typeof</code> of
            <a>sa:ContributorRole</a> and a property of either <a>schema:author</a> or
            <a>schema:contributor</a> depending on which is applicable. Modeling with schema.org

              <code>href</code> attribute linking to the element on which that affiliation is
              defined. The <code>a</code> element may contain arbitrary text (typically a number,
              letter, or symbol matching that used by the target in its own list). These should not

              contribution to the work (e.g. "Authors contributed equally" or "Designed the study").
              Each of those elements needs further to have a <code>resource</code>

              to <a>schema:ContactPoint</a>. The content of each <code>li</code> can be anything
              that describes a manner of contacting the author in question, but it will typically
              involve properties such as <a>schema:email</a>, <a>schema:telephone</a>,
              <a>schema:address</a>, <a>schema:description</a> (for arbitrary descriptions of the

            is an <code>h2</code> title appropriate for it, followed by either a <code>ul</code> or
            <code>ol</code>. Each <code>li</code> should be labeled with the role of <code>doc-endnote</code>. Note that this role is used for endnotes and footnotes alike.</p>
