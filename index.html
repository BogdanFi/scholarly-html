      <h2>Semantics Overlay</h2>
      <p>
        HTML provides an excellent backbone with which to capture the
        <a href="#structure">structure</a> of a given text but is naturally limited when it comes to
        capturing more domain-specific concepts such as people, spaceships,
        <a href="http://existentialcomics.com/comic/122">Humean causation</a>, or
        <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109888">sthenurines</a>.
        That is where semantic overlays with the ability to refine the meaning and relations of
        HTML elements come into play, more specifically <a role="doc-biblioref">RDFa</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The properties that Scholarly HTML captures are naturally document-related (authorship,
        keywords, license, citations, as well as specific structure types such as acknowledgements,
        introduction, or funding), which additionally requires the ability to describe people and
        organizations. There are numerous vocabularies that address this domain; however, for
        reasons detailed in
        <a href="https://research.science.ai/article/web-first-data-citations#choice-of-ontology">Web-First
        Data Citations</a> Scholarly HTML relies almost exclusively on
        <a role="doc-biblioref">schema.org</a>, complemented by a small number of additions from
        the <a href="#scholarly-article">Scholarly Article Vocabulary</a>.
