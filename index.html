      <h2>Semantics Overlay</h2>
      <p>
        HTML provides an excellent backbone with which to capture the
        <a href="#structure">structure</a> of a given text but is evidently limited when it comes to
        capturing more domain-specific concepts such as people, spaceships,
        <a href="http://existentialcomics.com/comic/122">Humean causation</a>, or
        <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109888">sthenurines</a>.
        That is where semantic overlays with the ability to refine the meaning and relations of
        HTML elements come into play. Scholarly HTML makes use of two standard mechanisms that
        overlay additional semantics atop the HTML DOM: role-based semantics as defined by
        <a role="doc-biblioref">WAI-ARIA</a> and <a role="doc-biblioref">DPUB-ARIA</a>, and
        semantics rooted in structured data as captured by <a role="doc-biblioref">RDFa</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The properties that Scholarly HTML uses are naturally document-related (authorship,
        keywords, license, citations, as well as specific structure types such as acknowledgements,
        introduction, or funding), which additionally requires the ability to describe people and
        organizations. There are numerous vocabularies that address this domain and which could be
        used with <a role="doc-biblioref">RDFa</a>; however, for reasons detailed in
        <a href="https://research.science.ai/article/web-first-data-citations#choice-of-ontology">Web-First
        Data Citations</a> Scholarly HTML relies almost exclusively on
        <a role="doc-biblioref">schema.org</a>, complemented by a small number of additions from
        the <a href="#scholarly-article">Scholarly Article Vocabulary</a>.
