      <h2>Semantics Overlay</h2>
      <p>
        HTML provides an excellent backbone with which to capture the
        <a href="#structure">structure</a> of a given text but is evidently limited when it comes to
        capturing more domain-specific concepts such as people, spaceships,
        <a href="http://existentialcomics.com/comic/122">Humean causation</a>, or
        <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109888">sthenurines</a>.
        That is where semantic overlays with the ability to refine the meaning and relations of
        HTML elements come into play. Scholarly HTML makes use of two standard mechanisms that
        overlay additional semantics atop the HTML DOM: role-based semantics as defined by
        <a role="doc-biblioref">WAI-ARIA</a> and <a role="doc-biblioref">DPUB-ARIA</a>, and
        semantics rooted in structured data as captured by <a role="doc-biblioref">RDFa</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using technologies related to the semantic web can at times feel daunting and unrelated to
        everyday web development. In order to suppress this disconnect, Scholarly HTML follows a
        few simple guiding principles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The number of prefixes used for semantic properties is kept as small as possible;
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no such thing as a URI (or URN, IRI, XRI, or whatever else confusing
          contraption), everything is a URL.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The properties that Scholarly HTML uses are naturally document-related (authorship,
        keywords, license, citations, as well as specific structure types such as acknowledgements,
        introduction, or funding), which additionally requires the ability to describe people and
        organizations. There are numerous vocabularies that address this domain and which could be
        used with <a role="doc-biblioref">RDFa</a>; however, for reasons detailed in
        <a href="https://research.science.ai/article/web-first-data-citations#choice-of-ontology">Web-First
        Data Citations</a> Scholarly HTML relies almost exclusively on
        <a role="doc-biblioref">schema.org</a>, complemented by a small number of additions from
        the <a href="#scholarly-article">Scholarly Article Vocabulary</a>.
      </p>
      <section id="article-title-semantics">
        <h3>Article and Title Semantics</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>article</code> element that roots the content of the Scholarly HTML document
          needs further refinement to capture the specific type of article that it encodes. The
          <code>typeof</code> attribute should always contain <a>schema:ScholarlyArticle</a> as its
          first item, but it can be further refined with additional article types.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          Should we recommend a specific taxonomy for article (sub)typing? There are so many:
          Fabio, MeSH, NPGâ€¦
        </p>
        <p>
          In order for arbitrary parts of the document to be able to attach metadata to the
          <code>article</code>, it also needs to have its <code>resource</code> attribute set to a
          URL that can be referenced (it is typically sufficient to just use <code>#</code> for that
          purpose).
        </p>
        <p>
          While the <code>h1</code> in the document's <code>header</code> is sufficient to convey
          the fact that it is the document's title, some services use extraneous information in
          order to assign an unambiguous title to the document. As such, it needs to have its
          <code>property</code> attribute set to <a>schema:name</a>. Similary, if a subtitle is
          present in the <code>header</code> it needs to be decorated with both a <code>role</code>
          of <code>doc-subtitle</code> (to expose its <a role="doc-biblioref">DPUB-ARIA</a>
          semantics) and a <code>property</code> of <a>schema:alternateName</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If appropriate, the beginning of the <code>article</code> is also a good place in which to
          capture the accessibility properties of the document, using the relevant parts of
          <a role="doc-biblioref">schema.org</a> (<a>schema:accessibilityFeature</a>,
          <a>schema:accessibilityHazard</a>, <a>schema:accessibilityAPI</a>, and
          <a>schema:accessibilityControl</a>, as detailed in
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Accessibility">the WebSchemas Accessibility
          wiki page</a>).
